    		a.	Only up to using PIR sensor
    		b.	Skip the Light-dependent resistor lab too
7. Lighting up an LED strip	
	a. RPi4 - https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/fully-addressable-rgb-raspberry-pi/
	b. RPi5 - Connect Pin 2 to +5V, Pin 6 to GND, and Pin 19 (GPIO 10 MOSI) to Din
		i. Run labs/ledstrip/spidev/wheel.py  (run turnoff.py as needed)
        	ii. See: https://github.com/hannescam/NeoSPI/issues/2
8. Make an LCD smart alarm clock
